            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There is no transfer service provided by RINDALI. However, we would assist you in arranging your transfer from Male to Maaenboodhoo Island via public speedboat ferry or domestic flight. To make the necessary arrangements and confirm the schedule of the speedboat transfer, it is recommended to contact us in advance.</p>

            <h2>1. Speedboat Transfer</h2>
            <p>(3 hours 30 minutes by speedboat ferry)</p>
            <p>Every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday, a private individual operates a speedboat ferry that travels in both directions. The ferry leaves from Male's south harbor at 12:15 p.m., charging $50 per person for a one-way trip. The journey typically lasts about 3 hours and 30 minutes. During the voyage, the ferry makes two or three stops at different islands, with approximately 30 minutes of waiting time expected at Meedhoo Island for refueling. Since it's a public ferry, we anticipate a large number of passengers on board.</p>

            <h2>2. Domestic Flight Transfer</h2>
            <p>(33 minutes flight + 10 minutes by speedboat)</p>
            <p>We are delighted to offer a convenient and efficient travel option for those of you who wish to take a short flight (33 mins) to the nearest domestic airport (Dhaalu Airport, also known as Kudahuvadhoo Airport) and then continue your journey to Maaenboodhoo via speedboat (10 mins). Our team is prepared to aid you in booking the flight and coordinating the speedboat transfer, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable travel experience.</p>

            <p>Booking flight tickets through us will result in a cost of around $160 per person/one way, as the airline has given us a special rate. You can hire a speedboat that can accommodate 6 people for $50.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that the airline doesn't offer ticket purchases on credit. Therefore, tickets can only be confirmed after payment is made. If you're ready to proceed with payment, we can assist you in making it through the following methods:</p>

            <h3>Payment Methods:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bank Transfer:</strong> You can transfer the ticket payment to our bank account via bank transfer, which typically takes 3-4 working days to process. Please note that you'll need to cover any associated bank fees. Once we've received the payment, we'll proceed to pay the airline and purchase your ticket.</li>
                <li><strong>
                  </li>
                  Credit Card Payment:</strong> We can provide you with a payment link for credit card payment through our bank. However, please note that a 3.5% bank fee will be added to the payable amount. Once we receive your payment, we'll proceed to pay the airline and purchase your ticket.</li>
