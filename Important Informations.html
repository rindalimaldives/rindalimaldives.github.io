            <p>The Maldives in located in the Indian Ocean, about 500 KM from the southern tips of both India. It is the Ideal exotic tropical island paradise.</p>
            <p>Independant since 1965, and a republic since 1968, the Maldives is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth and the Non-Aligned Movement. It maintains a very cordial relationship with the international community. Under the leaderships of both Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Mohamed Nasheed, the country is a champion of global peace and perservation of the environment.</p>
            <p>The population of the country currently stands at 2005 est about 300,000. A common language (Dhivehi) and religion (Islam) unite the people into cohesive, peaceful society. The country has been inhabited for atleast 25 centuries.</p>
            <p>The Maldives comprises about 1190 islands grouped into atolls protected by surrounding coral reefs. Coconut palms and various tropical plants grow in abundance on most islands.</p>
            <p>The Maldives straddles the equator and has a tropical climate. The southwest monsoon brings most of the rain, mostly around June and July. Normally, the skies are clear during the northeast monsoon.</p>
            <p>As of early 1970’s tourism has burgeoned in the Maldives. Surfers, divers, beach buffs, game fisherman and sea lovers find the Maldives ideal.</p>
            <p>The Maldives has increasingly become extremely accessible, especially by air. Scheduled and charter flights operate on a regular basis from points of origin in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Visitors are issued thirty day visa on arrival. Apart from normal Customs and Port Health formalities, nothing stands in the way of the inbound guest and tropical holiday.</p>

        <div class="heading" onclick="toggleContent('content2')">Geography and Climate</div>
        <div id="content2" class="content">
            <p>The Maldives is an archipelago of about 1190 islands grouped into natural coral atolls.</p>
            <p>One would expect the Indian Ocean, like any of the other oceans of the world to have its waves and other phenomena related to large bodies of water. The Indian Ocean does fulfill this expectation till one begins to approach any of the coral atolls right in the middle of it.</p>
            <p>An atoll is best visualized as a series of concentric layers. The outermost layer of the atoll is a strong reef. Composed of coral debris and living coral, this reef is a formidable barrier against rough seas. Once you gain access into the calm waters within, one is within the lagoon of the atoll proper.</p>
            <p>The islands of the atoll follow the outer reef. Sometimes an occasional island juts up from inside the lagoon.</p>
            <p>Each island has its own fringing reef. This adds to the protection. The water within this reef is often quite shallow. This aquamarine halo around the island in your picture postcard is this.</p>
            <p>Even though the islands of the Maldives are well sheltered from the oceanic waves, the ocean plays a major role in the climate of the country. It acts as a heat buffer, storing and giving up heat at a much slower rate than solid ground. Temperatures usually fluctuate between 23 degree Celsius and a maximum of 32 degree Celsius. There is always a cooling breeze blowing from the sea.</p>
            <p>The Maldives straddles the equator and lies outside the Indian Ocean cyclone belt.</p>
            <p>Some people find the Maldivian climate too monotonous. Length of the day never varies. Normally in June and July, the southwest monsoon is said to bring rain.</p>

        <div id="content3" class="content">
            <p>The Maldives have been inhabited for atleast 2500 years. Visited and enriched over the centuries by contact with sailors from all over, the country has evolved its unique culture.</p>
                <p>Before the Maldives converted to Islam in 1153 AD, Buddism was the prevalent religion. Ruins of stupas and other temples still exist to attest to this.</p>
                    <p>The Maldives has always been a very peaceful place apart from a few skirmishes with foreign invaders. The Portuguese, for example, occupied the nation for about 17 years in the 17th Century.</p>
                        <p>From 1887 to 1965, the Maldives was a British Protectorate. Since then, the Maldives has been a sovereign state.
                            <p>Since conversion to Islam, the Maldives remained a Sultanate till the proclamation of the First Republic in 1953. It failed. The Sultanate returned till the Second Republic was proclaimed in 1968. This time, it lasted.</p>
                                <p>Maldivian culture is unique and practical phenomenon born of the fisherfolk, the adventurer on the high seas, and the always-welcome guest. Binding this whole is a unique Sanskrit-driven language (called Dhivehi) and the Islamic faith.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
        <div class="heading" onclick="toggleContent('content4')">The People and the Language</div>
        <div id="content4" class="content">
            <p>Where did the people and the language of the Maldives come from?</p>
                <p></p>It is not recorded when and by whom the Maldives was first settled. However, archeological evidence and a look at the only language spoken in the country (called Dhivehi) tell an interesting story!</p>
                <p></p>The languages of the Maldives’ immediate neighbours are predominantly Dravidian (with the sole exception of Sinhala, which is spoken by the Sinhalese community in Sri Lanka), the Dhivehi language is Sanskrit based. Linguistic evidence clearly indicates this.</p>
                <p></p>Before conversion to Islam in 1153 AD, the predominant religion in the Maldives was Buddism (again something shared with the Sinhala-speakers of Sri Lanka, Sinhala being a Sanskrit-derived language as well). This, along with forklore and legend, points strongly to an Aryan migration from the ancient civilizations of MOhenjodaro and Harappa, at a time circa 500 BC.</p>
                <p></p>Things never remained that simple. The Maldives is placed right at the traders’ crossroads of the Indian Ocean. Daring seafarers from all around the known world often found respite on these islands. Some never left. All made their own contributions to the society and the gene pool of the people.</p>
                <p></p>As Maldivians themselves traveled far and wide, they brought home exotic products and left behind records of their visits. The documented visits made to the court of Roman Emperor Julian in 362 AD and visits to the court of Tang Dynasty Emperor of China in 658 AD are good examples.</p>
                <p></p>Maldivians later traveled to Bengal, Malaysia and the rest of Asia. This brought in strong influxes of these languages. Conversion to Islam brought in Arabic and Persian elements. The Portuguese who overcame the Maldives in the 16th Century added theirs. Maldivians sought education in Indian universities in the 18th Century brought Urdu and Hindi. In the 19th Century, British Empire contributed English.</p>
                <p></p>Maldivians have always welcomed and accomodated visitors who came in peace. Isolation was never practised. Cultural and other benificial influences were assimilated. Only threats to independence were repelled.</p>
                <p></p>The Maldives continues to remain a unified country witha unique culture and unique language with its own script, literature and history.

        <div id="content6" class="content">
            <p>You would expect plenty of boats in the Maldives… Rightly so! The Maldives cannot survive without boats and there are many. Let us first look at a few.</p>
            <p>The star performer is the traditional and ubiquitous dhoni. Each traditional dhoni is a unique vessel hand-built by a master craftsman even though mass-produced fiberglass versions have recently been introduced. Built of strong wooden planks, shaped round a strong wooden frame, the dhoni is built to sail in all seas. They are used as fishing vessels and as inter-island ferries throughout the Maldives. Traditionally sporting a versatile lateen sail, the dhoni has also married well with the marine diesel engine and has become the workhorse of even the tourism industry.</p>
            <p>Then there is the speedboat. In a country where the international airport is on an island all by itself, where the entire tourist resorts are on separate islands, the speedboat reigns king. It also performs well in recreation.</p>
            <p>Getting around in the Maldives is not restricted to a boat though. Seaplanes offer an even faster and scenic alternative, especially to distant resorts.</p>
            <p>On some of the bigger islands, especially on the capital island of Male’, the latest sports cars compete with motorcycles, scooters, and the sedate taxi.</p>
